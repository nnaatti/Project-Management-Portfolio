# Project Management Portfolio

A responsive portfolio website for a project manager, featuring sections for
about, services, selected projects, and a contact form.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page markup with hero, about, services, projects, and contact sections
- `styles.css` – site styles including responsive layout and navigation
- `script.js` – navigation toggle logic and scroll-triggered animations

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Push the site files to your repository and enable **GitHub Pages** in the
repository settings. Selecting the branch that contains `index.html` will serve
the portfolio instead of the default README view.

## Customization

- Replace "Your Name" in `index.html` with your own name and update the About section text.
- Update the contact info block in `index.html` with your email and phone number.
- Adjust project and service descriptions to reflect your experience.
