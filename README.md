# Project Management Portfolio

This is a simple portfolio website for project manager Alex Morgan. It showcases projects and includes a contact form. The site features a responsive navigation menu and a dark mode toggle.

## Development

This project uses npm for basic project tasks. After cloning the repository, install dependencies (currently none) and run the test script:

```
npm install
npm test
```

The test script is a placeholder and simply prints a message; feel free to replace it with real tests.
