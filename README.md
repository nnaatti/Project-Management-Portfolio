# Project Management Portfolio

A responsive portfolio website for project manager **Natnael Bedilu**, featuring
sections for about, services, selected projects, and a contact form.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page markup with hero, about, services, projects, and contact sections
- `styles.css` – site styles including responsive layout and navigation
- `script.js` – navigation toggle logic, scroll-triggered animations, email handler for the contact form, and theme switch

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Push the site files to your repository and enable **GitHub Pages** in the
repository settings. Selecting the branch that contains `index.html` will serve
the portfolio instead of the default README view.

## Customization

If you fork this repository, update the name and contact info in `index.html`
and adjust project and service descriptions to match your experience. The
contact form sends a `mailto` email to `natnaelamare1314@gmail.com`; change the
address in `script.js` if you want submissions delivered elsewhere. Use the
theme switch in the navigation menu to toggle light and dark modes; your
selection is saved in local storage.
