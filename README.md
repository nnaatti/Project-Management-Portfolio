# ERSAS Portfolio

A responsive portfolio site for ERSAS showcasing work, services, blog posts, and a contact form. The layout features a hero banner, smooth scroll animations, a mobile-friendly navigation menu, and a dark mode toggle.

## Development

This project uses npm for basic project tasks. After cloning the repository, install dependencies (currently none) and run the test script:

```
npm install
npm test
```

The test script is a placeholder and simply prints a message.
