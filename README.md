# Project Management Portfolio

A simple responsive portfolio website for a project manager.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main page markup
- `styles.css` – site styles
- `script.js` – navigation toggle logic

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Push the site files to your repository and enable **GitHub Pages** in the
repository settings. Selecting the branch that contains `index.html` will serve
the portfolio instead of the default README view.
